# github-actions-pr-merger
A GitHub Action which helps automating Pull Request merge routine (aka `Robin`).

Why Robin? As Robin was helping Batman fight the evil, so does Robin help with PRs merge routine.

Event `issue_comment` triggers GitHub Actions workflow on repository level instead of on PR checks level.
